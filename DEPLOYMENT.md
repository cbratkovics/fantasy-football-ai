cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# 2. Note the outputs
# - EC2 Public IP
# - RDS Endpoint
# - Redis Endpoint
```

### Phase 2: Application Setup (Week 1-2)
```bash
# 1. SSH into EC2 instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/fantasy-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2_IP>

# 2. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/cbratkovics/fantasy-football-ai.git
cd fantasy-football-ai

# 3. Configure production environment
cp .env.example .env.production
# Update with RDS and Redis endpoints

# 4. Start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Phase 3: Data & ML Pipeline (Week 2)
```bash
# 1. Initialize database
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# 2. Fetch initial data
docker-compose exec backend python -m data.fetch_historical

# 3. Train ML models
docker-compose exec backend python -m ml.train

# 4. Verify predictions
docker-compose exec backend python -m data.generate_predictions
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 3)
