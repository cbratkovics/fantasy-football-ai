# Redis Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue Summary
Railway deployment was failing due to a Redis package version conflict:
- `redis==4.6.0` (required by the project)
- `redis-py-cluster==2.1.3` (requires redis<4.0.0)
- `fastapi-limiter==0.1.5` (requires redis>=4.2.0,<5.0.0)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **redis-py-cluster** was listed in requirements.txt but not actually used in the codebase
2. Analysis showed no imports of `RedisCluster` or related clustering functionality
3. All Redis usage in the project uses standard Redis connections, not clusters

## Solution Implemented
Removed the unused `redis-py-cluster==2.1.3` dependency from requirements.txt

### Changes Made
1. **requirements.txt** (line 66):
   ```diff
   - redis-py-cluster==2.1.3
   + # redis-py-cluster==2.1.3  # Removed: Not used in code, conflicts with redis==4.6.0
   ```

2. Created **test_redis_connection.py** to validate the fix

## Verification
The project now has clean Redis dependencies:
- `redis==4.6.0` - Main Redis client
- `aioredis==2.0.1` - Async Redis support
- `fastapi-limiter==0.1.5` - Rate limiting (compatible with redis 4.6.0)

## Redis Usage in the Project
Redis is used for:
1. **Caching** (`core/cache.py`) - Standard Redis connections
2. **Rate Limiting** (`core/rate_limiter.py`) - Via fastapi-limiter
3. **WebSocket** (`core/websocket.py`) - Async Redis for pub/sub
4. **ML Scoring Engine** (`ml/scoring_engine.py`) - Result caching
5. **Data Sources** - Request caching for ESPN and weather APIs

None of these require Redis clustering functionality.

## Testing
Run the test script to verify Redis functionality:
```bash
python test_redis_connection.py
```

## Deployment Impact
- Railway deployment should now proceed without dependency conflicts
- No code changes required - only removed unused dependency
- All Redis functionality remains intact

## Future Considerations
1. If Redis clustering is needed in the future, use the built-in cluster support in redis>=4.0:
   ```python
   from redis.cluster import RedisCluster
   ```

2. Consider using connection pooling for better performance:
   ```python
   pool = redis.ConnectionPool.from_url(redis_url)
   r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
   ```

3. Monitor Redis memory usage in production and implement eviction policies if needed
