# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up the fantasy-football-ai backend project to remove clutter and improve organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Consolidation
- Created comprehensive `README.md` in backend root
- Consolidated deployment info into `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Created ML documentation in `docs/ML_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Archived 10 old documentation files to `docs/archive/`

### 2. Script Organization
Created organized script directories:
- `scripts/tests/` - 12 test files moved
- `scripts/training/` - 10 ML training scripts moved
- `scripts/data_collection/` - 5 data collection scripts moved
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts (validate_requirements.py, inspect_features.py)

### 3. Model Cleanup
- Kept only latest production models (20250731_171728)
- Archived older model versions to `models/production/archive/`
- Archived development models to `models/archive/`

### 4. Dockerfile Consolidation
- Kept main `Dockerfile` for production
- Archived 4 alternative Dockerfiles to `docs/archive/dockerfiles/`

### 5. Added Configuration Files
- Created `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- Created `.gitignore` to prevent tracking sensitive files
- `.python-version` already exists (Python 3.10)

### 6. Removed Duplicates
- Removed `external/sleeper_client.py` (duplicate)
- Kept both ESPN clients (they serve different purposes)
- Removed log files and temporary files

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner structure** - Easy to navigate
2. **Better documentation** - Consolidated and comprehensive
3. **Organized scripts** - Development tools separated from production code
4. **Reduced clutter** - 24+ files moved to appropriate directories
5. **Production ready** - Clear separation of dev and prod assets

## Next Steps
1. Update any imports that reference moved files
2. Test the application to ensure everything works
3. Update CI/CD pipelines if they reference old paths
4. Consider adding proper Python package structure with setup.py
