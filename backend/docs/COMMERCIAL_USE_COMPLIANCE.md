## üìã Implementation Guidelines

### For Production Use:
1. **Primary Sources**: Sleeper API + nfl_data_py + Open-Meteo
2. **Data Coverage**: 95%+ of required data from allowed sources
3. **Compliance**: All primary sources explicitly allow commercial use
4. **Cost**: $0 for data (only infrastructure costs)

### Best Practices:
1. **Always include User-Agent** headers with contact info
2. **Implement exponential backoff** for all API calls
3. **Cache aggressively** to minimize API load
4. **Monitor for ToS changes** quarterly
5. **Have fallback data sources** ready
